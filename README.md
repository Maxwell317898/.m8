# .m8 Format - Compressed HTML Protocol
[**Here is a DEMO that uses .m8 compression**](https://maxwell317898.github.io/.m8/) <br> <br>
**.m8** is a novel HTML compression format that reduces file sizes by replacing verbose HTML tags and attributes with compact numeric codes. Designed as both a transmission protocol and self-extracting file format, .m8 achieves 15-25% compression on typical web pages while maintaining full compatibility with standard HTML.
> [!CAUTION]
>Note that m8 is a Work In Progress, it should not be considered for production use yet
# This Branch is for development of the new dynamic compression table
this will assign digits to tags that are use more fequantly this should improve compression by 2.5%-10%
